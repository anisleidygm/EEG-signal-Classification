# Scalable AI-Driven Framework for Anomaly Detection in EEG Signals Using a Distributed-Delay Neural Mass Model

We introduce a cutting-edge pipeline that unifies advanced computational neuroscience and AI-based analytics to detect anomalies in EEG signals. At its core lies the Distributed-Delay Neural Mass Model (DD-NMM), a biologically grounded simulation of thalamocortical interactions incorporating realistic propagation delays among five key neuronal populations. Varying these excitatory–inhibitory parameters yields both healthy (alpha-dominant) and pathological (delta-dominant) EEG traces, subsequently expanded through phase shifting, frequency modulation, and additive noise. From these augmented signals, we extract five pivotal features—amplitude, delta/theta/alpha band power, and peak frequency—enabling a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to distinguish between healthy and seizure-like EEG with over 95% accuracy (cross-validated at 95.3% and independently tested at 94.7%. A one-class SVM further detects subtle outliers by learning a tight boundary around healthy data, highlighting emergent pathological states. Meanwhile, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualization confirms clear separations and sub-clustering in the feature space, reinforcing interpretability and validating the multi-step design. This pipeline excels in scalability and generalization, bridging the gap between theory-driven neural modeling and real-world EEG analytics. Beyond rapid seizure detection, it paves the way for multimodal neuroimaging studies, adaptive neurofeedback systems, and future-generation diagnostic tools.
